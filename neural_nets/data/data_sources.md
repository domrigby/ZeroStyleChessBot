# Data Sources
I did not include data sources but you can download the ones I used here:

1. [Kaggle Chess](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess?resource=download)
2. [OpeningTree](https://www.openingtree.com/)
3. [LiChess Puzzles](https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles)

I downloaded the pgns and then supervied_learning.py to pickle them.
